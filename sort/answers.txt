sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: First I found out that sort2 is merge sort so now i must differentiate between selection and bubble sort. For Omega notation (best case scenario)
i know that Bubble sort will operate faster than selection.

Sorted50000:
sort1: 0.561s ==> winner is Bubble sort!!
sort3: 3.064s

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: First i wanted to differentiate merge sort from the other two sorting methods. The Big O(n) notation for both selection and bubble are both O(n^2) while
for Merge sort it is O(nlogn.) By testing the worst case scenario (largest reversed data set) the quickest sort of the three will be Merge sort.

Reversed5000:
sort1: 5.71s
sort2: 0.662s ==> winner is Merge sort!!
sort3: 3.205s

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: When testing which non merge sort, sorting method runs the quickest for a sorted set, sort 3 took longer than sort 1 and was determined to be selection sort.
